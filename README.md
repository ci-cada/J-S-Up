# JavaScript learning.

Talk about learning, I decided to finally learn JavaScript after years of being afraid of the language.

It has similarities with Java as it is also used in web application programming and as a software engineer I need have skills in not less than 3 or 4 programming languages to make me flexible and also have experience. 

In this JavaScript Journey I will learn all there is to know about JavaScript, from the basics, intermediate and complex or professional level. Till I have that full JavaScript mastery.

### Resources

I will be utilising Youtube channels, Youtube, Hackerrank and Asabeneh's 30 Day of JavaScript(as my guide on hierachy) while learning JavaScript. 

### Goals

Perform tasks everyweek after each successful coding week, using the resources I have gained together with other languages(Since JavaScript works hand in hand with HTML and CSS) to build something responsive and perfect all together.

This will make me understand or know where I am going wrong or where I need be focusing on more often.

The challenges will be in this repo together with the codes with titles of the week( Week 1).
